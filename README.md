# Selenium-and-TestNG
This was an exercise where I used Selenium and TestNG to test an online application.
Unfortunately, I am not permitted to upload the web application since it is not my property. However, I uploaded Java code that I used to test the web application. The test code can be found at Domaci Selenijum i TestNG/src/test/java/. This test only tests 10 test cases. The other test cases were tested using different tools.
